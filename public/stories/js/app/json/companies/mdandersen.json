Oncologists hope to combine this genetic information with each patient’s individual history to create personalized evidence-based treatments. But the knowledge base for cancer is expanding so rapidly that oncologists can’t keep up with all the data, which impedes their ability to deliver up-to-date care.</p><p>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has turned this problem into an opportunity for cognitive systems to help oncologists treat cancer. Their solution, called the MD Anderson Oncology Expert Advisor<sup>&trade;</sup> powered by IBM Watson, ingests and analyzes medical evidence like published literature and practice guidelines, as well as recommendations and care pathways developed at MD Anderson, to suggest appropriate treatment options or clinical trials based on each individual patient’s profile. The ultimate vision is to reach more patients at the earliest stage of the disease, when the chances for a cure are highest.</p>"
