They needed fast, secure data transfer between database libraries and the cloud; an agile, secure private cloud for development; and rapid scalability for all their users.</p><p>With a SoftLayer hybrid cloud solution, they could precisely manage the data workloads their users demanded. Now over 250,000 people are playing Zya in 155 countries – and that's music to everyone's ears.</p>",
